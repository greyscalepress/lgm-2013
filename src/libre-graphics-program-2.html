Synfig</STRONG><BR><EM>Konstantin Dmitriev<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://morevnaproject.org/">morevnaproject.org/</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>In this workshop I'm going to demonstrate an approach for
character animation in Synfig. This approach allows to produce simple
but good-looking animation very quickly using the special template.
For more info please look at this demonstration -
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9d9a0zX5tg <BR>I am an animator with
a special interest to libre and open-source software. Since 2001 I am
teaching CG animation to kids and actively contributing to various
open-source software projects since 2007. My main role in the
open-source is leading the Morevna Project and helding administrator
responsiblities in Synfig Studio development (http://synfig.org/).
From time to time I like creating video tutorials about animation in
Synfig, also doing some random contributions to its code.</EM></P>

<P><EM>The Medialab-Prado media facade is a 15m x 10m low resolution
screen. It is an expensive infrastructure unique in the world. Until
now, creating content for the facade has been a slow process, where
apps has been done almost from scratch and with not so many people
creating content for it. How to open this huge infrastructure for a
massive and easy participation? <BR>Using the power of web
technologies we designed and coded &quot;Programalaplaza&quot; (code
the square) an online IDE which has all the elements to successfully
develop and show visual pieces on the facade only using a web
browser. It is based on Processing.js, a javascript version </EM><EM>of
the Processing language.</EM></P>

<P><EM>A typical Linux distribution's main task is to collect open
source software tools and package them together to provide users with
an installable software collection. Some distributions have
specialized in providing tools for artists; as a user, do you know
which is the right one to use? <BR>The Fedora Design Suite is a
so-called &quot;spin&quot; of Fedora providing applications for
designers and artists, collected by the Fedora Design Team. What
makes it different to other distributions for artists?</EM></P>
<P>17:50<BR><STRONG>Mikado, a &quot;Future tool&quot; for image
manipulation with graphs and nodes based on Tempi and GEGL</STRONG><BR><EM>Camille
Bissuel, Cedric Gémy, Alexandre Quessy<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://code.sat.qc.ca/tempi">code.sat.qc.ca/tempi</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>Mikado is a temporary project name for an image manipulation
program through a graphs and nodes interface. Most of the time image
editing requires little creative skill, but a lot of technical
processing. Today Computer graphics designers spend a lot of their
professional time at mechanical tasks like cropping, re-sizing,
optimize weight or change colorspace, and have no complete tool to
reduce this time. If you know some code, maybe scripting is a way,
but in most case you're reduced to repeat a same task again and again
with your favourite image manipulation program. On the other hand, to
be able to manage an image though the steps of its editing, seeing
the history of its creation while creating it is a direction we want
to explore. <BR>With Mikado we want to try building a node and graphs
interface which allow us to create half-automated scenarios of image
editing : Node and graphs seems complex at first glance, but are a
very powerful way to draw nonlinear scenarios (graphs), with
multiples inputs and outputs, giving us great freedom. In the long
run such a tool could be extended to other medias, for example to
generate live video contents for public events, or to produce music.
<BR>Mikado is an idea by Cédric Gémy and Alexandre Quessy.</EM></P>

<P><EM>Kune is a free/open source distributed social network focused
on collaboration rather than just on communication. That is, it
focuses on online real-time collaborative editing, decentralized
social networking and web publishing, while focusing on workgroups
rather than just on individuals. It aims to allow for the creation of
online spaces for collaborative work where organizations and
individuals can build projects online, coordinate common agendas, set
up virtual meetings, publish on the web, and join organizations with
similar interests. It has a special focus on Free Culture and social
movements needs. </EM>

<P><EM>This talk will explore the concept of canvas tool sharing.
<BR>What if we could share the interfaces of tools across
applications, and perhaps leverage easy scripting platforms like
Processing or paper.js to prototype tools, then easily (tm)
transplant to other platforms like Gimp or Inkscape. Artists and
designers could then fill their tool belt with their favorite tools,
and hack together custom ones as necessary, <BR>Since Inkscape, Gimp,
and others have very different internals, the problem is figuring out
enough in common that could be shared, minimizing the coding needed
to connect visual interfaces for humans to internal object structure
and rendering.</EM></P>

FontForge</STRONG><BR><EM>Ben Martin, Dave
Crossland<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://fontforge.github.com/">fontforge.github.com</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>DOOM was released 20 years ago and instantly became one of the
most important and influential computer games of all time. This was
not only thanks to its breakthrough graphics but also its multiplayer
network game mode. Since then many games have offered a mode where
game-world state is shared across the network in real-time, and some
of the most compelling gameplay involves players cooperating in
teams. <BR>Real time collaboration frees designers from having to
shuffle data from person to person when working together, such as
with distributed version control systems. VCS are excellent for slow
paced development over the Internet, but become cumbersome in a
fast-paced face-to-face studio environment. Yet unlike games, most
graphics applications (free and proprietary) lack such features. <BR>We
will demonstrate a new feature in FontForge for real time
collaboration, and explain at a high level how it works. </EM>

<P><EM>Interactivos?'13 is a two week prototyping workshop that will
start right after LGM. It will be an unique opportunity for software
developers, artists and designers from all over the world to
exchange, discuss, produce and imagine Free, Libre and Open source
tools for graphics and design. This edition focuses on (re)inventing
a Libre Graphics workflow that supports collaboration and exchange.</EM></P>
<P>10:20<BR><STRONG>Free Freedom of Speech Kit (F2SK)</STRONG><BR><EM>José

<P><EM>A portable digital device to show text messages (or even

software, it should be energetically autonomous, light and easy to
build. Simplifying the concept it can be thought as a DIY digital
banner for demonstrations. <BR>Therefore our proposal comprises the
design, development, production and creation of the Free Freedom of
Speech Kit to get a real device and an appropriate open, free SDK
control that allows any citizen to display their opinions in real
time, to use it as a social or even artistic creation tool.</EM></P>

Deswaef<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://w.xuv.be/projects/design_with_git">w.xuv.be/projects/design_with_git</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>As a designer, we usually think in visual terms. Let's see how
we could emulate the benefits of distributed source code in the rich
colors of a designer's world. <BR>Git is a distributed version
control system now wildly used in the free software world to
collaborate and keep track of source code. Since designers today use
more and more code to create their work, they naturally turn to Git
as a tool to manage their work in progress. The aim of the project is
to work on how Git can be integrated more into a graphical designers
workflow and create tools that would give a visual feedback of the
design changes and collaborations on a specific project.</EM></P>

<P><EM>Learning, building and having fun with stories about free
culture. <BR>A platform to construct narrative collages and co-create
stories dealing with free culture. Starting with a series of
concepts, places, situations, characters and a synopsis full of
rhythm, we will look for words, stories, persons, images, games,
songs, puns, humour and irony. We will be searching for sensations,
subtle intuitions or amusing metaphors that move us, inspire us…
The idea is to build stories that can transport the great adventure
of free culture and hacker ethics to the youngest minds. We want to
reflect on and display current cultural production, distribution and
access dynamics; and, above all, we would like to remix each step,
assemble collages and co-create with you.</EM></P>
<P>11:20<BR><STRONG>ZeroMQ and Real Time Collaborative Font
Design</STRONG><BR><EM>Ben Martin</EM></P>
<P><EM>Font design involves using at least two applications in
unison, a font editor and a page layout application: to draw letters,
and to read them. Real time collaboration features have been added to
the libre font editor FontForge, and we now need corresponding
features in libre graphics applications. This Interactivos workshop
aims to address this need with two goals: to implement support in
libre graphics applications for live fonts, and in addition, to draft
a spec for the future of font collaboration. <BR>Real time
collaboration has been implemented for FontForge using the zeroMQ
library. zmq was initially developed for financial service
corporations who must share a lot of data to a lot of people very
fast, such as in stock trading systems. It provides concurrency by
passing information as messages rather than a true shared state. The
current network protocol for sharing font data in FontForge could
become more like an interchange file format, to open up the
possibility for specialised font editor tools that are focused on
only some particular aspects of type design. For example, a program
for kerning with a tactile UI does not need to understand anything
about altering the shapes of glyphs, but can still be part of the
process. <BR>I will dive into the network protocol that currently
powers collaboration in FontForge, and set out my agenda for the
Interactivos workshop. </EM>

<P>12:00<BR><STRONG>Yes, No? Maybe</STRONG><BR><EM>Eleanor
Greenhalgh<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://eleanorg.org/">eleanorg.org/</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>When we create collaborative documents, what does it mean to
'consense'? This project will prototype an experimental system for
curating text publications, which allows for and records users'
ambivalence. <BR>Most tools for curating crowdsourced or
collaborative content encode politically-loaded assumptions about how
individuals make decisions. We 'like', vote up, approve, or blame the
texts of others. The &quot;most popular&quot; content wins; the
&quot;best&quot; of online content gets printed. But our social
decisions are not really so simple. This project draws on emerging
feminist theories of how we reach consent - as a fluid, ongoing and
often ambivalent process. 'Yes' doesn't always mean 'yes'. So how can
we encode 'maybe'?</EM></P>
<P>12:20<BR><STRONG>Incoma. Exploiting the &quot;collective&quot; of
the collective intelligence</STRONG><BR><EM>Miguel Arana Catania,
Carlos Barragán</EM></P>
<P><EM>We are witnessing a unique moment in history in which the
collective is becoming the major agent of change in our society.
However, we see how the current tools we interact with are not able
to fully exploit the potential of collective interaction, working
only for extremely small collectives or for large groups but
implementing far too simplistic actions. <BR>To deal with this, we
propose to focus on the collective intelligence and design an
internet platform that serves as a space for thought and discussion,
specifically designed to allow massive access and interactions,
without it generating the noise and chaos occurring in traditional
discussion tools, but real collective thoughts generated from
thousands of contributions. Later on, the tool could be used for more
specific collaborative tasks, such as collaborative writing, graphic
design, or other functions developed by its users.</EM></P>

<P><EM>El-Recetario.net is a collaborative platform for research and
experimentation on the use of waste to construct furniture and
accessories, where people can share what they do and how they do it,
learning from that and working with others. <BR>The project combines
four variables: <BR>a. research on the waste we produce and its
possible reuse as raw material for new objects; <BR>b. creating
manuals that can evolve and be shared; <BR>c. interaction and
collaboration amongst community members; <BR>d. and continuous
feedback between the virtual platform and actions in real life. <BR>The
proposal for the workshop is the update of the existing platform
El-Recetario.net to turn it into an open space that allows
collaborative work amongst its users to generate shareable materials
that encourage DIY and reuse of waste.</EM></P>

César</EM></P>
<P><EM>In a time of transition from print to digital, from copyright
to free culture, it is of capital importance to build bridges that
further the debate on the access to and appropriation of culture; the
photocopy has sustained such bridges since the mid 20th century. And,
in addition, it can be seen as an important forerunner both of
computation and of the democratization and distribution of
information. <BR>The aim of this project is to research the existing
relations between digital publishing and free culture, and more
specifically how to work with the digital &quot;photocopying&quot; of
books within the context of education. We will discuss and work with
digitalization and editing tools, we will distribute content using
FLOSS tools, and we will research and debate the legal implications
these practices have in different local contexts, especially in Latin
America.</EM></P>

<P><EM>The Tau Meta Tau Physica open source patternmaking software is
calling for collaborators to create an interactive prototype built to
HTML5 specifications using Processing.js. Tau Meta Tau Physica
replicates manual patternmaking processes in code. The project is
focused on generating sewing patterns. The current menu-driven batch
application is written in python and runs only on Linux. Implementing
the software with Processing.js will allow the program to run on
multiple operating systems and will add an interactive user
interface. Collaborators will be re-designing the software engine,
user interface, and project roadmap. Collaborators will learn how to
use Tau Meta Tau Physica to create design patterns. The resulting

<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://girinstud.io/">girinstud.io</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>Free, Libre and Open Source (FLOSS) has a wider support every
year for media creations: still images, 2D and 3D animations, videos,
and mixed media. Many workflows are therefore available, and
sometimes some workflow may be faster, easier, less repetitive,
result in better quality, etc. This workshop is about sharing
experiences. <BR>We will present our own workflow in a few minutes,
then will ask any other willing attendant to the workshop to present
their own in a few minutes as well. Hopefully this part should last
an hour. The next hour could be used by people meeting in smaller
groups and exchanging their ideas, their knowledge, showing more
accurately what they may have shown previously, ask questions, and so
on. <BR>The main goal is to share knowledge, experience, and help
people discover or re-discover their tools. <BR>Participants: <BR>-
even with no experience, if you are looking your way into graphics
FLOSS, you are still welcome to watch the presentations, and
participate in the second part. <BR>- if you show something in the
first part, you are expected to have a little experience. But every
workflow is interesting: even if you think it may be basic, it may
not be for less-experienced users and beginners who are still in the
mist. Also of course bring your laptop with your applications
pre-loaded. We are looking into real application usage, no &quot;slides&quot;.
<BR>- You can present a workflow for any kind of graphical art: still
image, pamphlet and poster layout, 2D, 3D, animation, video, etc. <BR>-
We would like to record every small presentation. So presenters are
asked if they accept the video to be distributed on the net under a
CC-by-sa license; and if your workflow includes any script, it would
be appreciated if you accepted for us to include it in an archive
with the video on a Free license as well. <BR>Workflows: <BR>- As
this is &quot;Libre *Graphics*&quot;, the workflow must have a
graphical component, but it can include other media, like music,
voice and sound record, and how you &quot;mix&quot; them with the
graphics. <BR>- The workflow must be mainly, if not fully, using
FLOSS. <BR>- A workflow can include also lower-level tasks: do you
use a source-repository for your media? Which one and how? Any useful
script? Have you &quot;industrialized&quot; your rendering tasks on a
render farm? All these are very important and interesting side of a
workflow, less visible but which can be a game-changer.</EM></P>

<P><EM>This talk presents the outcome of an intense 5-day graphic
design workshop, during which a team of twelve students (of HEAD
University of arts and design, Geneva) created a book of type
specimens entirely made with libre fonts. The book has been
mass-produced with cheap print-on-demand technology. This book will
be an unprecedented graphic item, since it differs from previously
existing specimen books in various ways: <BR>* It will focus on &quot;body
type&quot; - type that is suitable for long reading. No futuristic
display fonts, no cybernetic ninja glyphs, no blood-dripping zombie
script. Body type - workhorse fonts for real content. The most
unforgiving stress-test for a typeface. <BR>* It won't aim for
quantity. We won't try to impress the reader by the number of fonts
included in the book. The fonts will have all the space they need to
breathe and show their character. <BR>* It will be an open book, the
source (Scribus) files will be openly available and invite further
modifications and improvements by other designers. The repository is
here (you can already see some first alpha tests):

how these typefaces are created. This talk will throw light on the
process of designing type. Producing high-quality fonts requires a
team of collaborators. This includes a type designer, type director,
kerner, and hinter. I will share my collaborative experience that
resulted in releasing 30 opensource fonts for the Google Web Fonts
library, and explain how the team interactions work. My other focus
will be on the co-authorship aspect of developing opensource
multiscript fonts. Recently I assisted many designers in their
efforts to add Cyrillic extensions to their work. My job is to ensure
that the Cyrillic forms are correct, while the designers are
responsible for the graphic details of their typefaces. For this
purpose I launched learncyrillic.tumblr.com — an educational blog
with the aim of openly spreading knowledge on the subject, and
helping designers create their first Cyrillic.</EM></P>

<P><EM>During the last decade, topics such as free culture and open
knowledge have been increasingly present in formal education. The
latter often manifests itself as: the choice of open source software
for course preparation and assessments, the teaching of free software
tools for art and design students, the use of free culture licenses
for curriculum and research publications, the shift from top-down to
bottom-up course structure, the transformation of classrooms into
</EM><EM>hacklabs, or simply the inspiration provided by free, libre
and open source software development to approach art and design in a
novel way. Regardless of the form, it is undeniable that the
philosophy behind free software is transforming the academic field by
its re-interpretation and re-contextualisation in art and design
education. However, most of these efforts are often initiated by
individual and groups who by either lack of knowledge or by &quot;not
invented here&quot; pressure, tend to reinvent the wheel or miss
opportunities to expand their educational palette, whether it is
technical or conceptual. By hosting a meeting on this topic at LGM,
the open source domain team at the Willem de Kooning Academie hopes
to provide the first step towards the building of an international
network of peers interested in the link between free culture and art
and design education. More than a network with yet another platform,
we want to think of a simple way to build upon each others experience
and tap into everyone skills and specialisations when an educator
tries to solve a concrete problem (which software can I use for
this?), needs advice on a specific issue (what license to use for
that?) or needs to be connected with a broader scene of artists and
designers using free, libre and open source software (who can teach
this?). </EM>

for creative applications</STRONG><BR><EM>Pedro

<P><EM>Digital Art practice is changing, fueled by a collaborative
peer production and knowledge sharing ethic supported by open
hardware and software tools, hackerspaces and the Internet. With the
help of powerful programming libraries like Processing, Pure Data and
OpenFrameworks, it is now easier for artists to use programming as a
media for creativity and to explore the use of complex technologies
like realtime 3D graphics, video processing, and computer vision
algorithms. However, computer hardware is not getting easier to
program. Pushed by increasing demands in performance and power
consumption, hardware manufacturers have been building more parallel
processors which integrate many different functional units. These
heterogeneous parallel systems pose a cognitive challenge for
programmers, who need to abandon the mental model of the single
sequential processor. <BR>dataflower is a Free Software creative
programming environment, which aims to provide a solution for the
challenges posed by heterogeneous parallel architectures for
developing high performance interactive artworks. The environment is
based on dataflow, a well established model for creative programming,
and extends it to support rapid iteration, collaborative development
and progressive refinement. This research departs from well
established heterogeneous parallel programming techniques and is
focused on exploring and defining the user interface and experience
for the collaborative creative programming tools of the future.</EM></P>

Zajéga<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://www.numediart.org/">www.numediart.org</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>Melon is an application developed at Numediart Institute. Its
purpose is to simplify as much as possible the use of a Kinect sensor
as a controller by detecting the hands of user(s), retrieving their
position and, with this, moving a pointer on a graphical interface.
It has been developped in C++ and is based on Openni and NITE.
<BR></EM><EM>Functionalities: <BR>A. Interaction areas: In the Kinect
3D space, specific areas can be defined. When this feature is used,
users must position themselves into these areas to be detected. <BR>B.
Hand-tracking: Hand tracking is achieved relatively to shoulders,
making it user-centric. This allows users to move freely in space,
and also to change interaction areas position. The relative position
of the hand is not rendered as a 3D point, but as two angles
(horizontal and vertical rotation) and a radius. <BR>In order to
remove a part of the flickering due to Openni detection, a smooth
filter can be used to stabilise hand and/or shoulder position. <BR>C.
Melon parts: A second process localise the position in a portion of
sphere and return a normalised position. This &quot;melon part&quot;
is attached to the shoulder and represent an active area in front of
the user, defined by four angles, a minimal and a maximal radius.
This process makes straight lines easier to perform. <BR>D. OSC: Two
kind of OSC messages are emitted by the Melon: events and positions.
Events represent modification of status. When a new user is detected,
an event message is broadcasted. Melon also send events when a user
enters or leaves an interaction area, or when his hands enter or
leaves a melon part. <BR>Position messages contain the normalised and
absolute position of the hand. <BR>E. XML: The configuration of Melon
can be saved in XML files. <BR>F. GUI: The interface of Melon expose
all the configuration parameters in the GUI. A preview panel has been
added to visualise the configuration in realtime. <BR>Melon is fully
configurable. The example used to describe functionalities has been
chosen for the sake of clarity. Any points of the user's skeleton can
be considered as a pointer or an origin, the size and angles of melon
parts can be adjusted, multiple OSC ports can be activated. <BR>----

Public Domain Remix</STRONG><BR><EM>Kat Braybrooke, Primavera De

<P><EM>The past decade has seen an amazing amount of unexpected
collaborations between artists working with open hardware, open
design and public domain reinterpretation for intriguing results. In
London, Milan and Paris, Helsinki, Amsterdam and Madrid, a group of
designers and makers has started a collective called the Open Design
Working Group http://design.okfn.org with the Open Knowledge
Foundation in order to explore these connections. <BR>Along with
running the first-ever &quot;Open Design, Hardware, Fabrication and
Making&quot; topic stream at OKFestival 2012 in Helsinki
http://okfestival.org/open-design/, the Open Design Working Group has
just released v. 0.1 of the Open Design Definition - a Github-based
attempt to discuss the intricacies of Open Design licensing and
attribution to clarify design frameworks across paradigms as they
relate to openness. http://design.okfn.org/current-projects/ <BR>To
augment these discussions, the Open Design collective also launches
the world's first Public Domain Remix (Domain Publique Remix)
challenge in France this Spring with Wikimedia </EM><EM>France - an
annual initiative to leverage artistic innovation through creative
multimedia reinterpretations of public domain works. As an example of
such glitch remixes, Primavera will describe the methodology between
the interactive kinetic sculpture &quot;Mechalgorythm&quot;, which
pays homage to Jean Tinguely's Metamatic works by producing
generative works of its own art
http://www.kinetica-artfair.com/?exhibitors/2013/okhaos-creations.
<BR>This talk will be an invitation for discussion, contemplation and
critical re-engagement with the concepts explored through such
attempts to combine design methodologies across paradigms in an age
of rapid technological change.</EM></P>

<P><EM>The Piksels and Lines Orchestra is an experimental performance
system for graphic design. <BR>The image industry populates our
visual culture, yet it exists in a world with an inner life that is
invisible to most people. The orchestra shifts the focus from the end
results to the actions and decisions that take place during the
creative process. <BR>By turning the tools of graphic design, the
software applications, into instruments, the active labour and the
operational gestures of designers are converted to sound. Actions
like painting, cutting, setting text, adding layers, drawing shapes
etc. are reflected by sonic events within a score. <BR>At the same
time, the system brings the audience visually into the everyday work
environment of the designer by exposing the application interfaces as
they are used. In order to make the necessary software modifications,
the applications used in this project are all free and open source
software.</EM></P>

Wikipedia, and contribute to the creation of previously identified
resources or those requested by the community, in the field of
graphics, specially -but not only- illustration and vector graphics.
The Commons community, like most Wikimedia projects, relies on the
voluntary work of thousands of people, who enjoy bringing their
knowledge and time for building a collective project of high quality,
with huge impact on the web, since Wikipedia is the fifth most
visited site in the world. Professional and amateurs coexist in the
community, working together based on consensually defined quality
parameters. The workshop offers an introduction to the working
dynamics of Commons, trough a particular </EM><EM>practice of design
with free software. <BR>Preparation (those interested in the workshop
have to perform these two tasks previously): <BR>- Create a
user-account in Commons (very important!) <BR>- Review artworks
present Commons in your area of interest. Please visit:

<P><EM>MyPaint is, and has always been about one major tool: the
brush. While conceptually and technically quite simple, the brush
engine in MyPaint allows for fun and expressive brushes that many
digital painters love. The existence of many well-designed 'brush
packs' gives users instant access to a range of interesting and
useful brushes, from those that emulate real media to those that
enable &quot;not-quite-natural&quot; painting. <BR>The MyPaint brush
engine been available for use in other applications for a long time,
but recent developments has made this even easier. This goal of this
talk is to demonstrate why you would want to use the engine in your
application, and how you can do this in 100 lines of code or less.
<BR>Jon Nordby is a software engineer with a background in open

OpenRaster. He currently lives in Oslo, working on microphone array
systems and cautiously exploring more artistic perspectives on the

new ways</STRONG><BR><EM>Manufactura Independente, Ana Isabel
Carvalho and Ricardo Lafuente<BR></EM><EM><A HREF="http://manufacturaindependente.org/">manufacturaindependente.org</A></EM></P>
<P><EM>This talk proposal follows on the issues surrounding libre
type design that we began to explore at our last LGM talk, “The
awesome things that libre web type enables you to do”. <BR>There is
a premise that one must spend considerable amounts of time perfecting
a typeface, with timeframes going from months to years. Besides the
“creative” part of the work, there’s a significant amount of
boring workhorse tasks: checking spacings, comparing glyphs, testing
use cases. Another unwritten rule in conventional type design is that
typefaces ought to be released only in a finished form. Because most
traditional type design is, in one way or another, a commercial
endeavour, there is little openness towards unfinished or speculative
typeface development. <BR>No wonder, therefore, that thousands of
unfinished typefaces sit inside dark corners of designers’
filesystems and notebooks, condemned to the most perverse kind of
bitrot: “Someday I’ll finish it”. <BR>Manufactura Independente
will go over how applying F/LOSS development principles can provide
new paths out of this tired way of working. This will be accompanied
by a set of practical examples gathered from the designers’ own
experience with collaborative development and typeface design,
including a first look at Manufactura’s latest project -- Oxshark
Fontworks -- a proposal they’ve been developing to tackle the
aforementioned issues.</EM></P>
