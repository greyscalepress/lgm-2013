TextWrangler regex search sample:

Search: <h2 class="title">([^>]*)</h2>

Replace: <h1 class="title">\1</h1> (aside- if it's a h1 do you still want to preserve the 'class="title"'?)

Note the brackets in the search regex, which save what's inside them.

Then you use \1 to pull them back out in the replace text (\1 for the first set of brackets, \2 for the second, ... )
