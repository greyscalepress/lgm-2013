LGM 
2013
[Fieldnotes]

Attending and speaking at the South By Southwest Interactive Conference, I made a limited edition set of "fieldnotes" for myself and some of my friends attending. The fieldnotes compiled useful short-term information, and went on to form the basis of my contribution to the Post-Digital Media panel.

The panel’s about post-digital design, or what we could and should be thinking about when we can blend physical and digital formats in new and interesting ways. As part of my own preparations and thinking, I (surprise!) made a book.
